## Overview

Period Tracker is a Python application that tracks user's menstrual cycle's while simultaneously predicting future cycles. Period Tracker allows users to specify when menstruation starts and stops, as well as any symptoms associated with their menstrual cycle such as headaches, cramps, or fatigue. Through the use of the Period Tracker, users can confidently monitor their menstrual cycles while maintaining necessary health privacy.

**Note**: The functions of this application are only as accurate as the user is consistent with tracking.

## How to Use Period Tracker

### Installation/Setup

Setup of Period Tracker is quick and easy. Before running the program, first install the required packages by running `pip3 install requirements.txt`.

### Running Period Tracker

Now you are all set to run the app! Run the progam with `python3 main.py`, and click on `Follow link` that pops up when hovering over `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in the terminal.

When the app is run for the first time, a database called `period_tracker.db` will be created. This is where all of your information will be stored and retrieved when using the application. If any period start or period stop days are changed within the app, the application will have to be closed and started again before future predicted period days are updated.

## To Do

- Create notifications to alert user when their period is projected to start.
- Update style sheet to make the application look more visually appealing.
